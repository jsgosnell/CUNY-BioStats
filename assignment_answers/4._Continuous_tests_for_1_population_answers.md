Before doing this, review the **Introduction to normality and one-sample tests for continous data** lecture set slides from 
https://sites.google.com/view/biostats/lessons/hypothesis-testing-with-the-binomial-distribution and
the  **4_normality.R** script in the lecture_files folder of the
[CUNY-BioStats github repository](https://github.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats).

You’ll also use the qqplot_example.R and
central_limit_theorem.R script from the 
[code_examples folder](https://github.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/tree/master/code_examples).

## Examples

From lecture! Consider if average height of males training at the Australian 
Institute of Sport is different than average of human population. 

These are all one sample tests, but they differ in what we know. If we know the
variance of our population, we use a z test (function in BSDA package).


```r
sport <- read.table("http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ais.txt", header = T)
library(BSDA)
```

```
## Loading required package: lattice
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'BSDA'
```

```
## The following object is masked from 'package:datasets':
## 
##     Orange
```

```r
z.test(sport[sport$Sex == "male", "Ht"], mu = 175.6, sigma.x=7)
```

```
## 
## 	One-sample z-Test
## 
## data:  sport[sport$Sex == "male", "Ht"]
## z = 14.292, p-value < 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 175.6
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  184.1474 186.8643
## sample estimates:
## mean of x 
##  185.5059
```
If we don't, we use a t-test


```r
t.test(sport[sport$Sex == "male", "Ht"], mu = 175.6)
```

```
## 
## 	One Sample t-test
## 
## data:  sport[sport$Sex == "male", "Ht"]
## t = 12.658, df = 101, p-value < 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 175.6
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  183.9535 187.0583
## sample estimates:
## mean of x 
##  185.5059
```

These both assume the means of the data are normal! If we want to relax that 
assumption, we can use the Wilcoxon test (also known as Mann-Whitney test, signed
binary transform, or other terms!). This assumes the distribution of means is
symmetric.


```r
wilcox.test(sport[sport$Sex == "male", "Ht"], mu = 175.6)
```

```
## 
## 	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction
## 
## data:  sport[sport$Sex == "male", "Ht"]
## V = 5052, p-value = 5.714e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true location is not equal to 175.6
```

or the sign-test/media test.


```r
SIGN.test(sport[sport$Sex == "male", "Ht"], md = 175.6)
```

```
## 
## 	One-sample Sign-Test
## 
## data:  sport[sport$Sex == "male", "Ht"]
## s = 90, p-value = 8.882e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true median is not equal to 175.6
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  183.9000 187.4684
## sample estimates:
## median of x 
##      185.55 
## 
## Achieved and Interpolated Confidence Intervals: 
## 
##                   Conf.Level L.E.pt   U.E.pt
## Lower Achieved CI     0.9406  183.9 187.3000
## Interpolated CI       0.9500  183.9 187.4684
## Upper Achieved CI     0.9629  183.9 187.7000
```

Note this is just transforming data to 1/0 and doing a binomial test!


```r
above_175.6 <- nrow(sport[sport$Sex == "male" & sport$Ht > 175.6,])
binom.test(above_175.6, nrow(sport[sport$Sex == "male",]))
```

```
## 
## 	Exact binomial test
## 
## data:  above_175.6 and nrow(sport[sport$Sex == "male", ])
## number of successes = 90, number of trials = 102, p-value = 6.125e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  0.8035103 0.9377091
## sample estimates:
## probability of success 
##              0.8823529
```



We can also bootstrap the data.


```r
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/master/code_examples/bootstrapjsg.R")
bootstrapjsg(data1=sport[sport$Sex == "male", "Ht"], null=175.6)
```

```

```
##                                                                         
##                  "0.95" "% Confidence Interval"      "183.963725490196" 
##

```

## Let's practice!

### Recognizing and assessing normality 

#### 1

1. Using the qqplot_example.R code, examine the following distributions and, for 
the continuous distributions (marked with a “*”), observe how a normal probability
plot (qqplot) can be used to visually test for approximate normality.

* *Normal (u= 0; σ^2^= 1, 10, 100) 
* *Student's t (df = 1, 10, 30, & 100) 
* *Chi-square (df= 1, 2, 5, 30, 50)
* Bernoulli (P=0.1, 0.5, & 0.9) 
* Binomial (P=0.05; N= 2, 5, 25, & 50); (P=0.25; N= 2, 5, 25, & 50); (P=0.50; 
N= 2, 5, 25, & 50); (P=0.75; N= 2, 5, 25, & 50); (P=0.95; N= 2, 5, 25, & 50) 
* Poisson ( u= 2, 5, 10, 30, & 50)

For this question, its easiest to just source the main file and see what happens.
When you source a script, it is run in R without showing any console output
(but graphs and objects are still produced!).  Try *source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/master/code_examples/qqplot_example.R")*


```r

2. Review the central_limit_theorem.R code if you need to convince/remind 
yourself how common normality of means is for even non-normal data. You can source the code
using the same approach noted in Question 1.

*Here we are focused on how the means look as sample size increases*

### Working with data (note some sample sizes may be too small for these to all be good ideas!)

Make sure you are comfortable with null and alternative hypotheses for all examples. 
You should also feel comfortable graphing the data.

3. Seven observers were shown, for a brief period, a grill with 161 flies impaled 
and were asked to estimate the number. The results are given by Cochran (1954). 
Based on five estimates, they were 183.2, 149.0, 154.0, 167.2, 187.2, 158.0, and 143.0. Test the null hypothesis that the mean of the estimates is 161 flies.

* Assuming variance = 275



```r
flies <- c(183.2, 149.0, 154.0, 167.2, 187.2, 158.0, 143.0)
library(BSDA)
z.test(x=flies, mu = 161, sigma.x=sqrt(275))
```

```
## 
## 	One-sample z-Test
## 
## data:  flies
## z = 0.33276, p-value = 0.7393
## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 161
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  150.8010 175.3704
## sample estimates:
## mean of x 
##  163.0857
```
*Using a z-test, I found a test statistics of z~=0.33 .This corresponds to a p-value of 0.73. This p value is >.05, so I fail to reject 
the null hypothesis that the mean of the estimates is 161 flies.*

*  Estimating the variance from the data

```r
t.test(x=flies,mu = 161)
```

```
## 
## 	One Sample t-test
## 
## data:  flies
## t = 0.32656, df = 6, p-value = 0.7551
## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 161
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  147.4576 178.7138
## sample estimates:
## mean of x 
##  163.0857
```
*Using a t-test, which is appropriate when the variance must be estimated
from the sample and the means of the data may be assumed to follow a normal 
distribution,  I found a test statistics of t~6~=0.32.  This corresponds to a 
p-value of 0.76. This p-value is >.05, so I fail to reject 
the null hypothesis that the mean of the estimates is 161 flies.*

* Using rank transform analysis 


```r
wilcox.test(flies, mu=161)
```

```
## 
## 	Wilcoxon signed rank exact test
## 
## data:  flies
## V = 15, p-value = 0.9375
## alternative hypothesis: true location is not equal to 161
```
*Using a Wilcoxon signed rank test, which is appropriate when normality assumptions 
can't be met and the distribution of the data appears to be symmetric, I found a test
statistics of V = 15 .This corresponds to a p-value of 0.94. This p-value is >.05, so I 
fail to reject the null hypothesis that the mean of the estimates is 161 flies.*

* Using binary transform analysis

```r
SIGN.test(flies, md=161)
```

```
## 
## 	One-sample Sign-Test
## 
## data:  flies
## s = 3, p-value = 1
## alternative hypothesis: true median is not equal to 161
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  144.8857 185.9429
## sample estimates:
## median of x 
##         158 
## 
## Achieved and Interpolated Confidence Intervals: 
## 
##                   Conf.Level   L.E.pt   U.E.pt
## Lower Achieved CI     0.8750 149.0000 183.2000
## Interpolated CI       0.9500 144.8857 185.9429
## Upper Achieved CI     0.9844 143.0000 187.2000
```

*Using a sign test, which is appropriate when the data is continuous and other 
assumptions can't be met, I found a test statistics of s = 3 .This corresponds to a p-value of 1. This p-value is >.05, so I fail to reject 
the null hypothesis that the median (**Note change here**) of the estimates is
161 flies.*

Note there are several ways to load the data!  You can make a list (since the 
list is short):


```r
flies <- c(183.2, 149.0, 154.0, 167.2, 187.2, 158.0, 143.0 )
```

or make a dataframe in a spreadsheet software (eg, Excel, Google Sheets) and then upload using a read.csv command. We did this in the introduction to R!

4. Yields of 10 strawberry plants in a uniformity trial are given by Baker and 
Baker (1953) as 239, 176, 235, 217, 234, 216, 318, 190, 181, and 225 g.

5. Evolutionary geneticists predicts the family sex ratio will be 80% female in 
broods of eagles that successfully fledge >3 young. Nests that fledge 3 or more

6. Studies of flying snakes have led researchers to posit the mean undulation 
rate is 1.4 Hz.  You wish to test this hypothesis using the small sample of 
undulation rates shown below.  Create a small dataset of the paradise tree snake 
undulation rates and choose and justify a test you can use to assess the data.

Undulation rates (in Hz):  0.9, 1.4, 1.2, 1.2, 1.3, 2.0, 1.4, 1.6


```r
snakes <- c(0.9, 1.4, 1.2, 1.2, 1.3, 2.0, 1.4, 1.6)

7.  Using data from Australian athletes (http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ais.html 
for details), determine if the average male training at the Australian Institute 
of Sport differs in weight from the average Australian male (85.9 kg) using
bootstrapping techniques. Data at 


```r

*Using a bootstrap test wtih 10,000 samples, we found a p-value of .007; we thus 
reject the null hypothesis that males training at the AIS have the same weight as
the average Australian male.  Data indicated they weigh less.*
