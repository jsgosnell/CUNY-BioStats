## Instructions! Read this first.

The exam is open note, open course website, open class-related code
repositories (mine and those you produced in class). However, you may
not get external help ( from other students, directed internet searches,
etc.). Please update the statement below to acknowledge these
instructions (and that you can use git).

I, INSERT YOUR NAME HERE, promise to not seek external help on the exam.
I understand any academic issues will result in a D or F on the exam or
in the class and be reported to the Dean of Students. Infractions will
also result in me being unable to obtain a letter of recommendation from
the department for professional school applications.

Good luck!

## Background

Scenario is based on real issues but not real data; images are from a
variety of sources.

[![](images/clipboard-1549301531.png)](https://www.pickpik.com/dawn-drone-dusk-mountains-outdoors-sunrise-132011#google_vignette)

Drones (unmanned aerial vehicles) are becoming increasingly common.
Their impact on wildlife, however, is unknown. A lab interested in
considering drone impacts and has collected data from a number of
studies.

## #1

For one study, the impact of drones no owl residence was considered. Two
sites at a local park were considered; previous studies had indicated
the two areas had similar environmental conditions and were accessed by
a local population of screech owl. Each site contained 48 nest boxes
similar to the one shown below. (6 pts)

Site A was disturbed by a drone for 2 hours on June 3, 2023; Site B was
not. The following morning nest boxes were checked. At Site A, 35 boxes
were occupied by owls. At Site B, 22 boxes were occupied by owls. Does
the data indicate an impact of drones on owl occupancy?

Investigate the question. Make sure you include

-   null hypothesis (1 pt)

    -   *H~0~: there is no difference in owl occupancy among sites or
        drone impacts (confounded, which is common!); occupancy is not
        contingent on site or drones*

-   alternative hypothesis(1 pt)

    -   *H~A~: there is a difference in owl occupancy among sites or
        drone impacts (confounded, which is common!); occupancy is
        contingent on site or drones*

-   explanation for test you will use (1.5 pt)

    -   I will attempt to use a $\chi^2$ test given we have discrete
        data from 2 populations (contingency analysis)

-   results from statistical test (1 pt)

```{r}
chisq.test(matrix(c(35,22,48-35,48-22), nrow=2, byrow = T))
```

Note

```{r}
chisq.test(matrix(c(35,22,48-35,48-22), nrow=2, byrow = F))
```

-   clear explanation of how results relate to your stated hypotheses
    (1.5 pt)
    -   The test led to a value of $\chi^2 = 6.22$, with a corresponding
        p-value of 0.012. Thus I reject the null hypothesis.

## #2

Are there any potential issues with the data used in problem number 1 or
the resulting conclusions? How would you make the experiment better? (3
pts)

*A lack of replication means potential differences may be due to sites.
However, the before/after approach minimizes this. A larger sample (or
more sites) would also be useful.*

## #3

A follow-up study considered the impact of drones urban and rural parks.
Similar to the study in question #1, plots at 15 urban and 15 rural
parks were considered. For each type of park, 5 sites had no drone
activity, 5 sites had low drone activity, and 5 sites had high drone
activity. Impacts were considered by measuring the acoustic activity of
birds at each site (in decibels, db).

Make the data

```{r}
set.seed(42)
decibel <- data.frame(park_type = c(rep("rural", 30), rep("urban", 30)), 
                       drone_activity = rep(c(rep("none", 10), rep("low", 10), rep("high", 10)), 2),
                       db = c(rnorm(10, 40 ,10), rnorm(10, 60, 10), rnorm(10, 80,  10), rnorm(30, 70, 10)), stringsAsFactors = T) 
saveRDS(decibel, file = "decibel.rds")
```

Data can be read in using this chunk. Is there any evidence for impacts
of park type or drone activity levels on bird activity? (6 pts)

```{r}
decibel <- readRDS("decibel.rds")
```

Investigate the question. Make sure you include

-   null hypothesis (1 pt)

    -   *H~0~: \# there is no difference in mean decibel level between
        the 2 park types sites;*
    -   *H~0~: \# there is no difference in mean decibel level among the
        three levels of drone activity;*
    -   *H~0~: \# there is no interaction between park type and drone
        activity level on mean decibel level*

-   alternative hypothesis (1 pt)

    -   *H~0~: \# there is a difference in mean decibel level between
        the 2 park types sites;*
    -   *H~0~: \# there is a difference in mean decibel level among the
        three levels of drone activity;*
    -   *H~0~: \# there is a interaction between park type and drone
        activity level on mean decibel level*

-   explanation for test you will use (1.5 pt)

    -   the outcome is a continuous variable, and we are considering
        differences based on membership in 2 categories. Given the lack
        of linkages among measurements, this is a factorial ANOVA. I
        will use that approach to consider main effects and interaction.

-   results from statistical test (1 pt)

```{r}
decibel_model <- lm(db~park_type*drone_activity, decibel)
plot(decibel_model)
```

Assumptinons appear to be met

```{r}
library(car)
Anova(decibel_model, type="III")
```

there is an interaction, so I will investigate the impact of drone
activity level separately for each park.

```{r}
decibel_model_urban <- lm(db~drone_activity, 
                          decibel[decibel$park_type=="urban",])
plot(decibel_model_urban)
```

Assumptions are met for the urban park model.

```{r}
Anova(decibel_model_urban, type="III")
```

There is no impact of drone activity level on mean decibel level in
urban parks (F~2,27~ = 0,38,
p=`r round(data.frame(Anova(decibel_model_urban, type="III"))["drone_activity","Pr..F."],2)`).

For rural parks,

```{r}
decibel_model_rural <- lm(db~drone_activity, 
                          decibel[decibel$park_type=="rural",])
plot(decibel_model_rural)
```

Assumptions are met

```{r}
Anova(decibel_model_rural, type="III")
```

There does appear to be an impact of drone activity (F~2,27~==5.442, p =
\<0.01). A post hoc test using Tukeys approach to correct for FWER was
employed to determine which groups were different

```{r}
library(multcomp)
summary(glht(decibel_model_rural, linfct = mcp(drone_activity="Tukey")))
```

Results indicate all activity levels differ rom others. - clear
explanation of how results relate to your stated hypotheses (1.5 pt) - I
reject the null hypothesis of no interaction. Further investigation
suggests the difference is based on rural, and not urban, parks.

## #4

Graph the data from question 3.(5 pt)

Several options

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(Rmisc)
decibel_summary <- summarySE(decibel, measurevar = "db", groupvars = c("drone_activity", "park_type"))

ggplot(decibel_summary, aes(x=drone_activity, color=park_type, y=db))+
  geom_col(aes(fill=park_type), position=position_dodge()) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=db-ci, ymax=db+ci), position=position_dodge()) +
  labs(title="Oyster lengths at 3 restoration sites",
       y= "Oyster length (mm)",
       x= "Site")

ggplot(decibel_summary, aes(x=drone_activity, color=park_type, y=db, group=park_type))+
  geom_point() +
  labs(title="Oyster lengths at 3 restoration sites",
       y= "Oyster length (mm)",
       x= "Site")+
  geom_line()

ggplot(decibel, aes(x=drone_activity, color=park_type, y=db))+
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title="Oyster lengths at 3 restoration sites",
       y= "Oyster length (mm)",
       x= "Site")



```

## #5

Another investigator considered the level of drone activity as number of
flying minutes per day. They then wanted to compare this to measured
decibels of bird activity.

```{r}
set.seed(18)
decibel_2 <- data.frame(minutes_flying = runif(100,0,100))
decibel_2$db <- 80-decibel_2$minutes_flying*.4 + runif(100,-2,2)
saveRDS(decibel_2, "decibel_2.rds")
```

Data can be downloaded using this chunk

```{r}
decibel_2 <- readRDS("decibel_2.rds")
```

Investigate the question. (6 pts)

Make sure you include

-   null hypothesis (1 pt)

    -   *H~0~: there is no relationship between the noise level of
        drones and bird activity.*

-   alternative hypothesis (1 pt)

    -   *H~0~: there is a relationship between the noise level of drones
        and bird activity.*

-   explanation for test you will use (1.5 pt)

    -   *I will use a regression to compare the relationship between
        bird and drone noise levels.*

-   results from statistical test (1 pt)

```{r}
regression <- lm(db~minutes_flying, decibel_2)
plot(regression)
```

Assumptions are met.

```{r}
Anova(regression, type = "III")
summary(regression)
```

Output shows a significant, negative relationship.

-   clear explanation of how results relate to your stated hypotheses

    -   *I found a p-value of \<0.01, so I reject the null (1.5 pt)
        hypothesis.*
