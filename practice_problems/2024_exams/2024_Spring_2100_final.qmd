## Instructions! Read this first.

The exam is open note, open course website, open class-related code
repositories (mine and those you produced in class). However, you may
not get external help ( from other students, directed internet searches,
etc.). Please update the statement below to acknowledge these
instructions (and that you can use git).

I, INSERT YOUR NAME HERE, promise to not seek external help on the exam.
I understand any academic issues will result in a D or F on the exam or
in the class and be reported to the Dean of Students. Infractions will
also result in me being unable to obtain a letter of recommendation from
the department for professional school applications.

Good luck!

## Background

Scenario is based on real issues but not real data; images are from a
variety of sources.

Drones (unmanned aerial vehicles) are becoming increasingly common.
Their impact on wildlife, however, is unknown. A lab interested in
considering drone impacts and has collected data from a number of
studies.

## #1

For one study, the impact of drones no owl residence was considered. Two
sites at a local park were considered; previous studies had indicated
the two areas had similar environmental conditions and were accessed by
a local population of screech owl. Each site contained 48 nest boxes
similar to the one shown below. (6 pts)

Site A was disturbed by a drone for 2 hours on June 3, 2023; Site B was
not. The following morning nest boxes were checked. At Site A, 35 boxes
were occupied by owls. At Site B, 22 boxes were occupied by owls. Does
the data indicate an impact of drones on owl occupancy?

Investigate the question. Make sure you include

-   null hypothesis (1 pt)
-   alternative hypothesis(1 pt)
-   explanation for test you will use  (1.5 pt)
-   results from statistical test (1 pt)
-   clear explanation of how results relate to your stated hypotheses (1.5 pt)

## #2

Are there any potential issues with the data used in problem number 1 or
the resulting conclusions? How would you make the experiment better? (3
pts)


## #3

A follow-up study considered the impact of drones urban and rural parks.
Similar to the study in question #1, plots at 15 urban and 15 rural
parks were considered. For each type of park, 5 sites had no drone
activity, 5 sites had low drone activity, and 5 sites had high drone
activity. Impacts were considered by measuring the acoustic activity of
birds at each site (in decibels, db).

Data can be read in using this chunk. Is there any evidence for impacts
of park type or drone activity levels on bird activity? (6 pts)

```{r}
decibel <- readRDS("decibel.rds")
```


Investigate the question. Make sure you include

-   null hypothesis (1 pt)
-   alternative hypothesis(1 pt)
-   explanation for test you will use  (1.5 pt)
-   results from statistical test (1 pt)
-   clear explanation of how results relate to your stated hypotheses (1.5 pt)

## #4

Graph the data from question 3.(5 pt)

## #5

Another investigator considered the level of drone activity as number of
flying minutes per day. They then wanted to compare this to measured
decibels of bird activity. 


Data can be downloaded using this chunk

```{r}
decibel_2 <- readRDS("decibel_2.rds")
```
