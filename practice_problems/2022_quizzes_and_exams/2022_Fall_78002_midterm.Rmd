# Instructions! Read this first.

The exam is open note, open course website, open class-related code repositories 
(mine and those you produced in class). However, you may not get external help (
from other students, directed internet searches, etc.).  Please update the statement
below to acknowledge these instructions (and that you can use git).

I, INSERT YOUR NAME HERE, promise to not seek external help on the exam. I 
understand any academic issues will result in a D or F on the exam or in the class
and be reported to the Dean of Students. 

Good luck!

# Werewolf (Halloween Redux!) 

![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-huSpt_sT7HI/WAmTUUV9GAI/AAAAAAAAZgQ/hWJ8TZx5MGAPuK5MFuRFEWdrAdMib4uqwCEw/s320/IMG_2931.JPG)

Many cultures have stories of people transforming into animals. Lycanthropy, or 
people becoming (or thinking they become) wolves is a common example that connects 
to the mythos around werewolves.

Imagine werewolves are actually real and are caused by a virus that quickly spreads 
in communities. However, not everyone who has the virus transforms into werewolves
for a number of reasons.  While society has ways to deal with the virus (and werewolves),
the virus that causes people to transform is continuously evolving and thus must
be studied (does all this sound familiar?). A recent strain of concern has been noted.  

Many of these questions follow from the [78001 exam](https://docs.google.com/document/d/154CLTdYMcluSzlovlcPg-9Z-_Zt6xjDsUJqICBdqAao/edit?usp=sharing){target = "_blank"}.

# #1

1. Following up on the 78001 exam, conduct the analysis you recommended for the 
sleep tracker study.  As a reminder, 
a study is done to determine if the new strain leads to more people becoming 
werewolves. Historically,
10% of people in the focal town transformed during full moons. Last month, a study 
using sleep trackers found 17 out of 110 subjects infected with the new strain
became werewolves.  Is there 
evidence that transformations are becoming more common with this strain?  Make 
sure you include

* null hypothesis (1 pt)
* alternative hypothesis (1 pt)
* explanation for test you will use (1 pt)
* results from statistical test (1 pt)
* clear explanation of how results relate to your stated hypotheses (2 pt)

# #2

2. Develop confidence intervals to match this data and explain what they mean. (2 pts) 


# #3

3.  Analyze the data from the class question on vaccine impacts. As a reminder,
as one attempt at controlling the outbreak, a company has developed a drug
that it claims reduces the chances of people transforming.  150 participants, all
of who transformed during the last full moon, are selected to take part in clinical 
trials.  A third (the control group) receive a  placebo, a third receive a single 
dose of the new drug, and a third receive 2 doses.  During the next full moon, 33 out of 50 individuals in the control
group transform into wolves.  43 out of 50 in the single dose group transform, and 
45 out of 50 in the 2-dose group transform. (6 pts) 

Use this data
to investigate the impact of the drug. Make sure you include

* null hypothesis (1 pt)
* alternative hypothesis (1 pt)
* explanation for test you will use (1 pt)
* results from statistical test (1 pt)
* clear explanation of how results relate to your stated hypotheses (2 pt)

# #4

4. Analyze the data from the follow-up vaccine study. As a reminder,
In later correspondence, the company scientist note they also tracked adverse 
reactions including changes in height in a follow-up study because people are 
concerned werewolf vaccines can do strange things.  The dataset includes information
on participant gender (M, F); treatment (Control (no vaccine), single or double 
dose; and change in height in mm. Data can be downloaded using.

```{r}
height <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/master/datasets/vaccine_height.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
```

Use this data
to investigate the impact of the drug on changes in height. Make sure you include

* null hypothesis (1 pt)
* alternative hypothesis (1 pt)
* explanation for test you will use (1 pt)
* results from statistical test (1 pt)
* clear explanation of how results relate to your stated hypotheses (2 pt)

# #5

5. (From question 7 in class) 60 participants were randomly selected from 
the nation wide (United States)
transformation registry.  Each individual was outfitted with heart rate and lux
(light intensity) monitors to study relationship between average heart rate five
minutes around maximum lunar light intensity. Data is available @ 

```{r}
moonlight <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/master/datasets/moonlight.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
```


Analyze the data. Make sure to include

* null hypothesis (1 pt)
* alternative hypothesis (1 pt)
* explanation for test you will use (1 pt)
* results from statistical test (1 pt)
* clear explanation of how results relate to your stated hypotheses (2 pt)

# #6

6. Graph the data used in question 5 in an appropriate way (5 pts)
