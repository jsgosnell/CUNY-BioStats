# Instructions! Read this first.

The exam is open note, open course website, open class-related code repositories 
(mine and those you produced in class). However, you may not get external help (
from other students, directed internet searches, etc.).  Please update the statement
below to acknowledge these instructions (and that you can use git).

I, INSERT YOUR NAME HERE, promise to not seek external help on the exam. I 
understand any academic issues will result in a D or F on the exam or in the class
and be reported to the Dean of Students. 

Good luck!

# Werewolf (Halloween Redux!) 

![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-huSpt_sT7HI/WAmTUUV9GAI/AAAAAAAAZgQ/hWJ8TZx5MGAPuK5MFuRFEWdrAdMib4uqwCEw/s320/IMG_2931.JPG)

Many cultures have stories of people transforming into animals. Lycanthropy, or 
people becoming (or thinking they become) wolves is a common example that connects 
to the mythos around werewolves.

Imagine werewolves are actually real and are caused by a virus that quickly spreads 
in communities. However, not everyone who has the virus transforms into werewolves
for a number of reasons.  While society has ways to deal with the virus (and werewolves),
the virus that causes people to transform is continuously evolving and thus must
be studied (does all this sound familiar?). A recent strain of concern has been noted.  

# #1

1. Following up on the 78001 exam, conduct the analysis you recommended for the 
sleep tracker study.  As a reminder, 
a study is done to determine if the new strain leads to more people becoming 
werewolves. Historically,
10% of people in the focal town transformed during full moons. Last month, a study 
using sleep trackers found 17 out of 111 subjects infected with the new strain
became werewolves.  Is there 
evidence that transformations are becoming more common with this strain?  Make 
sure you include

* null hypothesis (1 pt)
  * *H~0~: # of people transforming is no different with new strain/is equal to 10%*
* alternative hypothesis (1 pt)
  * *H~A~: # of people transforming is  different with new strain/is not equal to 10%*
* explanation for test you will use (1 pt)
  * *I will use a binomial test to compare the calculated transformation rate to a 
  a given value.*
* results from statistical test (1 pt)

```{r}
binom.test(17,111, p=.1)

#or 

binom.test(17,111, p=.1, alternative = "greater")

```
* clear explanation of how results relate to your stated hypotheses (2 pt)
  * *I found a p-value of .03 (<.05), so I reject the null hypothesis. The 
  number of people transforming has changed. **BONUS/not required** It appears to 
  be increasing.*

# #2

2. A local agency wants to know what percentage of people they might predict will transform 
during the next full moon
as the new strain spreads.  What would you tell them? (2 pts). 

*I would develop confidence intervals to help them predict the future given 
uncertainty in our estimate*

```{r}
library(binom)
binom.confint(17,111)
```

*The 95% confidence interval is 9.7-23.3% using the Agresti-Coull method (1 pts). A 
95% confidence interval means if we sampled the population many times and 
constructed confidence intervals for each sample, 95% of the time the interval 
would contain the true population parameter. (1 pts)*

3. There is also concern that the new strain of lycanthropic virus is leading
to not just more werewolves, but also to larger werewolves. In the past, people 
were the same weight in their
human and wolf forms.  Recent data on peoples weight in human and wolf form was collected 
at a secure facility.  

Data is available using (wide format)

```{r}
size_wide <- read.csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQPEgn69EFpp6-FLOCuMjBHQg2de2eufsk1tot5_pet4PBWw7LONCpzHRgV9F7o4_qR8lxAjhfltCjK/pub?gid=1132258987&single=true&output=csv", 
                      stringsAsFactors = T)
```

or (long format)

```{r}
size_long <- read.csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTuKbRFnuaRITxnQXmeTBzlBVtJYcRYH50MFrvhXnud8PevFo2E-eTeqvqqZvrSNp0iV-R96YZub0Du/pub?gid=528744338&single=true&output=csv",
                      stringsAsFactors = T)
```

What does it suggest?  (6 pts)

Investigate the question. Make sure you include


* null hypothesis (1 pt)
  * *H~0~: the proportion of people transforming is the same with and without the drug*
* alternative hypothesis (1 pt)
  * *H~A~: the proportion of people transforming is the same with and without the drug*
* explanation for test you will use (1 pt)
  * I will use a goodness of fit test/contingency analysis. Data are count-based.
  I will check assumptions once model is created.
* results from statistical test (1 pt)

```{r}
outcomes <- matrix(c(33, 50-33, 43, 50 - 43, 45, 50-45), nrow = 3, byrow = T)
colnames(outcomes) <- c("change", "not change")
rownames(outcomes)<- c("control", "single", "double")

chisq.test(outcomes)

library(rcompanion)
pairwiseNominalIndependence(outcomes, compare = "row", method = "holm")
```


# #4

4. Graph the data used in question 3 in an appropriate way that lets you visually
compare the groups (several options here!) (5 pts)



# #5
5.  As one attempt at controlling the outbreak, a company has developed a drug
that it claims reduces the chances of people transforming.  100 participants, all
of who transformed during the last full moon, are selected to take part in clinical 
trials.  Half (the control group) receive a  placebo, and the other half receive
the new drug. During the next full moon, 38 out of 50 individuals in the control
group transform into wolves.  43 out of 50 in the drug group transform. (6 pts) 

Use this data
to investigate the impact of the drug. Make sure you include

* null hypothesis
* alternative hypothesis
* explanation for test you will use 
* results from statistical test
* clear explanation of how results relate to your stated hypotheses



# #6

6. Given your answer to #5, what is your recommendation regarding the drug? In 
your answer, make sure to include the p-value and explain what it means.  (2 pts)
