The salamander scientists continued their work.  In another study, the authors
determined the impact of temperature on heart rate. Data is available @

```{r}
temperature <- read.csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRhcbtbwuBje-9I7abkP2EXWuddGVo5VH1N2CgNtR8NMj-sjS-9KXjrJuZY9an9Gt4c-JbdCwwP9S0B/pub?gid=1230482827&single=true&output=csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
```

How would you analyze the data? Make sure you include

* null hypothesis
* alternative hypothesis
* explanation for test you will use 
* results from statistical test
* clear explanation of how results relate to your stated hypotheses
* a properly-labelled plot of the data. There are many options here, but
make sure you show trends and patterns that match your analysis.
