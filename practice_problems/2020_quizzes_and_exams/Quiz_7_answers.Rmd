Building on earlier experiments (Quiz 5 and 6!), scientists now wonder if the 
impact of the biocontrol agents depends on the presence of an aphid competitor.  Scientists measure the number of damaged leaves along 10 m surveys
in fields that have had no biocontrol (control) and those where parasitic wasps (Figure 1)
or predatory
ladybugs (Figure 2) have been released. These fields also differ in the presence 
of the aphid competitor.  Data is available using

[comment]:(hidden and not evaluated in answer key; this is how I created the data)
```{r eval = F, include=F}
set.seed(8)
damage_competitor <- data.frame(treatment = c(rep("ladybug",50), rep("wasp", 50),
                                          rep("control", 50)), 
                     competitor = rep(c(rep("present", 25), rep("absent", 25)), 3),
                            leaf_damage = c(40 + round(rnorm(25,0,5)),
                                            25 + round(rnorm(25,0,5)),
                                            40 + round(rnorm(25,0,5)),
                                            40 + round(rnorm(25,0,6)),
                                            40 + round(rnorm(25,0,5)),
                                            65 + round(rnorm(25,0,4))))
write.csv(damage_competitor, "damage_competitor.csv", row.names = F)

```{r}
damage_competitor <- read.csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTRtyKuFbpcwdBZISTxSI4Eyl7V9fdtH0TyB-Pgwum2YS676Okhu9TtB1n3HlOcXIuYSh--faebX9Gb/pub?gid=1533136727&single=true&output=csv", header = T, stringsAsFactors = T)

Make sure your answers include

* null hypothesis

*We have three null hypotheses here*:

* *There is no difference in the average number of damaged leaves based on 
biocontrol agent*

* *There is no difference in the average number of damaged leaves based on 
competitor presence*

* *There is no interaction between competitor presence and biocontrol agent on
the the average number of damaged leaves* 

* alternative hypothesis

*We have three alternative hypotheses here:*

* *There is a difference in the average number of damaged leaves based on 
biocontrol agent*

* *There is a difference in the average number of damaged leaves based on 
competitor presence*

* *There is an interaction between competitor presence and biocontrol agent on
the the average number of damaged leaves* 

* explanation for test you will use

*We will use a factorial ANOVA to examine the data. The outcome is continuous 
and both explanatory variables are categorical. The design is also fully randomized.*

* results from statistical test (including post-hoc tests if needed!)
```{r}
damage_competitor_lm <- lm(leaf_damage~treatment*competitor, damage_competitor)
plot(damage_competitor_lm)
library(car)
Anova(damage_competitor_lm, type = "III")
```

*I first built and checked a linear model. Assumptions were met
as evidenced by the
residual plots
(there is no pattern in the residuals and they are normally distributed).
Analysis shows a significant interaction (F~2,144~=162.93, p<.01) between 
competitor and treatment. This means I can't simply look at main effects as they
depend on each other, so I have to split the data into subsets for analysis.*

```{r}
damage_competitor_present_lm <- lm(leaf_damage~treatment, 
                           damage_competitor[damage_competitor$competitor == "present",])
plot(damage_competitor_present_lm)
Anova(damage_competitor_present_lm, type = "III")
```

*When the competitor is present, there is no impact of biocontrol agents 
(F~2,72~= .08, p = .92), so for this subset I fail to reject the null hypothesis 
of no difference among treatments.*


```{r}
damage_competitor_absent_lm <- lm(leaf_damage~treatment, 
                           damage_competitor[damage_competitor$competitor == "absent",])
plot(damage_competitor_absent_lm)
Anova(damage_competitor_absent_lm, type = "III")
library(multcomp)
damage_compare <-   glht(damage_competitor_absent_lm, linfct = mcp(treatment = "Tukey"))
summary(damage_compare)
```

*When the competitor is absent, there is an impact of biocontrol agents 
(F~2,72~= 263, p <.01), so for this subset I reject the null hypothesis 
of no difference among treatments.  Since there are more than 2 groups I need to do post hoc tests to understand which groups are different.  A tukey approach 
indicates all treatments are different when the competitor is absent.*

* clear explanation of how results relate to your stated hypotheses

*Noted above.*

* a graph that clearly displays the data

*One option shown below!*

```{r}
library(Rmisc)
damage_competitor_summary <- summarySE(damage_competitor, measurevar = "leaf_damage", groupvars = c("treatment", "competitor"))
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(damage_competitor_summary, aes(x=treatment, y=leaf_damage, fill = competitor))+
  geom_col(position = "dodge", size = 4, width = .5) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = leaf_damage-ci, ymax = leaf_damage+ci), 
                position = position_dodge(.5), width = 0)+
  xlab("Biocontrol treatment")+
  ylab("Number of damaged leaves")+
  ggtitle("Biocontrols differ in impacts on leaf damage")

```
