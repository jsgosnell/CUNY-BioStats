# Biocontrol effectiveness!

One way to reduce herbivory by invasive species is biocontrol - the intentional 
release or supplementation of species that prey on a pest.  To consider if biocontrol
is effective at reducing aphid density across generations, 
scientists consider the number of aphids in square meter plots at 20 fields 
prior to the release of biocontrol agents. A year later they visit the same plots
and sample for aphids again.  Data is available using

[comment]:(hidden and not evaluated in answer key; this is how I created the data)
```{r eval=F, include=F}
set.seed(2)
aphid_density <- data.frame(field = letters[1:25],before = 150 +round(rnorm(25,0,40)))
aphid_density$after <- aphid_density$before - 15 + rnorm(25,0,3)
write.csv(aphid_density, "aphid_density.csv", row.names = F)
```

```{r}
aphid_density <- read.csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR7IAJjpKonpJLjENw9GQ7tiZm63YZZq5ed7es0OFceWvEqvPSiqpYrEnnKiCsNGIspUhn3YDry_ChF/pub?gid=552866496&single=true&output=csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
```

How would you evaluate the data?

In case it helps (it may not, but I want you to know how to melt data into long format)

```{r}
library(reshape2)
aphid_density_long <- melt(aphid_density, id.vars = "field", variable.name = "before_after",
                           value.name = "aphid_density")
```

Make sure your answers include

* null hypothesis

*There is no impact of biocontrol on aphid density, so the mean difference between
the two samples is 0.*

* alternative hypothesis

*There is an impact of biocontrol on aphid density, so the mean difference between
the two samples is not 0.*

* explanation for test you will use

*I will use a paired t-test since the data consists of continuous measures and
each unit (field) is measured twice.*

* results from statistical test (including post-hoc tests if needed!)

```{r}
t.test(aphid_density$before, aphid_density$after, paired = T)
```
*Using a paired t-test, we found t~24~=24.225, p<.01. Note a non-paired test leads
to different outcomes!*

```{r}
t.test(aphid_density$before, aphid_density$after)
```

* clear explanation of how results relate to your stated hypotheses

*We can reject the null hypothesis using a paired test. There appears to be a
decreasee in density based on biocontrol application. 
* a graph that clearly displays the data

*Many options here. However, note that focusing on change makes the outcome
easier to see.*

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
aphid_density$change <- aphid_density$before - aphid_density$after
ggplot(aphid_density, aes(x="", y =change)) +

  ylab("Difference in aphid density (per square meter) 
       before and after biocontrol application")+
  ggtitle("More aphids were observed before biocontrol application")

  geom_histogram() +
  ylab("Frequency")+
  xlab("Difference in aphid density (per square meter) 
  before and after biocontrol application")+

aphid_summary <- summarySE(aphid_density_long, measurevar = "aphid_density",
                           groupvars = "before_after")
