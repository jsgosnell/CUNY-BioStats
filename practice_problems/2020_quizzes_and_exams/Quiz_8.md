# Vaccine effectiveness

A recent study of the new coronavirus vaccine produced by Johnson and
Johnson led to a surprising result. Lower dosages of the vaccine led to
a higher effectiveness. Typically one would assume that higher dosages
are better.

Higher dosages, however, may lead to more side effects and also impact
availability. Imagine a study considering dosage level (of a different
vaccine) impacts on systolic blood pressure (a potential side effect).
Data can be found at

``` r
dosage <- read.csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSEsIPp-49ERvzN2EAC37NrSr9GLsWFTVgIIjBxGwloYoxz5mpUTJ2KCH7kXVxBGLtg9eSLs6YIx32E/pub?gid=993951219&single=true&output=csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
```

How would you evaluate the results?

Make sure your answers include

-   null hypothesis
-   alternative hypothesis
-   graph that clearly displays the data and represents these hypotheses
-   explanation for test you will use
-   results from statistical test (including post-hoc tests if needed
    and indication of how much variation the model explains!)
-   clear explanation of how results relate to your stated hypotheses
