# Vaccine effectiveness

An earlier study (Quiz 8) focused on a relationship between dosage and
systolic blood pressure). A follow-up wanted to consider if ethnicity
impacted this relationship. Data were collected from 4 different groups
(labeled A-D here) on vaccine dosage level and systolic blood pressure.
Data can be found at

``` r
dosage_group <- read.csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSXfNA4nl1SRK6BDxfJqo7izW254hxP8N4tjK9snXZngfgQFJ3aeKlg5EAAWPfrStv_61e3FKsAOjjx/pub?gid=73925069&single=true&output=csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
```

How would you evaluate the results?

Make sure your answers include

-   null hypothesis

*We have three null hypotheses here*:

-   *There is no difference in systolic blood pressure based on dosage*

-   *There is no difference in systolic blood pressure based on group*

-   *There is no interaction between group and dosage agent on systolic
    blood pressure*

-   alternative hypothesis

*We have three alternative hypotheses here*:

-   *There is a difference in systolic blood pressure based on dosage*

-   *There is a difference in systolic blood pressure based on group*

-   *There is an interaction between group and dosage agent on systolic
    blood pressure*

-   graph that clearly displays the data and represents these hypotheses

``` r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(dosage_group, aes(x=dose_micrograms, y=systolic, shape = group, 
                         color = group)) +
         geom_point()+
         geom_smooth(method="lm")+
         xlab("Vaccine dose (micrograms)")+
         ylab("Systolic blood pressure")+
         ggtitle("Systolic blood pressure increases as vaccine dosage increases,
                 but impacts differ among groups")
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'

-   explanation for test you will use

*I will use an ANCOVA here. The explanatory variables combine a
continuous and categorial variable, the outcome is continuous and should
follow a normal distribution (so should meet model assumptions).*

-   results from statistical test (including post-hoc tests if needed
    and indication of how much variation the model explains!)

``` r
impacts_group <- lm(systolic~dose_micrograms*group, dosage_group)
plot(impacts_group)

*I first ensured model assumptions were met. Plots show no patterns in
residuals and a relatively normal distribution, which means they are.
Analysis indicates no significant interaction between dose and group on
systolic blood pressure (F<sub>3,192</sub>=.87,p = .46), so I fail to
reject the null hypothesis that an interaction does note exist. Given
this, I remove the interaction from the model.*

*Analysis of the reduced model suggests that both dosage
(F<sub>1,195</sub>=3232, p \<.01) and group (F<sub>3,195</sub>=493, p
\<.01) have a significant impact on systolic blood pressure, so I reject
both related null hypotheses. Since there are more than 2 groups, I used
post-hoc tests to determine which groups were different. Analysis using
Tukey tests shows that groups A and B do not differ, but all other
possible pairs are significantly different. Full model analysis
indicates dosage level and group explains 96% of the variation in blood
pressure (this an example!).*
