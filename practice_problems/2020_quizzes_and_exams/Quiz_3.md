# ZOMBIES!

You wake up one morning and find that zombies have taken over your
neighborhood (bummer).

Evidence also suggests that temperature may influence propensity for
zombie a ttacks, with zombies preferring warmer bodies. Long-term
studies suggest that average human temperature is 36.57 C.  
Unfortunately, measuring temperatures before/after attacks is hard, so
data on 5 survivors of attacks have been recorded. They were: 36.12,
36.37, 35.7, 36.01, 36.9.

1.  Is there any evidence that temperature influences zombie attacks?

2.  How would knowing the standard deviation of human temperature is
    0.42 change your methods and results?

Make sure your answers include

- null hypothesis
- alternative hypothesis
- explanation for test you will use
- results from statistical test
- clear explanation of how results relate to your stated hypotheses
- confidence interval for your estimate
