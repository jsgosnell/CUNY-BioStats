# ZOMBIES!

You wake up one morning and find that zombies have taken over your neighborhood (bummer).
One idea is to use biocontrol to reduce zombie attacks. A zombie parasite is 
identified.  Test plots (neighborhoods!) are subjected to one or two releases of 
the parasite at low, medium, or high densities. Use the data (in R chunk below!)
to construct a graph 
(You should use a bar graph with confidence intervals!)
that properly summarizes how the number of releases impacts the number of 
zombie attacks.  

```{r}
biocontrol <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/master/datasets/biocontrol.csv",
                       stringsAsFactors = T)
```
