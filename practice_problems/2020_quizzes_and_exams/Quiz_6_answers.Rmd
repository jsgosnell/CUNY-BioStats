Building on earlier experiments (Quiz 5!), a group of scientists is now considering
if the usefulness of 2 different predators in controlling herbivory by an invasive
aphid.  Scientists measure the number of damaged leaves along 10 m surveys
in fields that have had no biocontrol (control) and those where parasitic wasps
(Figure 1)
or predatory
ladybugs (Figure 2). Data is available using

[comment]:(hidden and not evaluated in answer key; this is how I created the data)
```{r eval=F, include=F}
set.seed(2)
damage <- data.frame(treatment = c(rep("ladybug",25), rep("wasp", 25),
                                          rep("control", 25)), 
                            leaf_damage = c(25 + round(rnorm(25,0,5)),
                                            40 + round(rnorm(25,0,6)),
                                            65 + round(rnorm(25,0,4))))
write.csv(damage, "damage.csv", row.names = F)
```

```{r}
damage <- read.csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRHZzd1CivJEUGnZetFnou_pEgyJD93G2-GHs2wNMMb2p-uXAN9sybg7sPfRcd7i_nUF65bGHwbQ8ph/pub?gid=976089384&single=true&output=csv", header = T, stringsAsFactors = T)
```

How would you evaluate the data?

Make sure your answers include

* null hypothesis

*There is no difference in the average number of damaged leaves based on treatment*
-> mean number damaged leaves~control_plot~ = 
mean number of damaged leaves~wasp_plots~ =
mean number of damaged leaves~ladybug_plots~ 

* alternative hypothesis

*There is a difference in the average number of damaged leaves based on treatment*
-> **So at least one of the following equalities does not hold!**

mean number damaged leaves~control~ = 
mean number of damaged leaves~wasp~ =
mean number of damaged leaves~ladybug~ 

* explanation for test you will use

*I will use an ANOVA (form of linear model) since the outcome is a continuous variable and we are considering differences among groups.*  

* results from statistical test (including post-hoc tests if needed!)

```{r}
damage_lm <- lm(leaf_damage~treatment, damage)
plot(damage_lm)
library(car)
Anova(damage_lm, type = "III")
library(multcomp)
damage_compare <-   glht(damage_lm, linfct = mcp(treatment = "Tukey"))
summary(damage_compare)
```

*I first found that the  model was appropriate as evidenced by the
residual plots
(there is no pattern in the residuals and they are normally distributed).  The
ANOVA led to an F~2,72~ value of 296.25 and a p-value of <.01, so I reject the 
null hypothesis of no difference among groups. Given there are more than 2 groups,
I next carried out post-hoc tests to determine which groups were different. Post
hoc tests using the Tukey approach showed that all treatments differed from all
others.  The graph (below) and estimates showed that control plots suffered 
the most damage, followed by wasp and ladybug plots.*

* clear explanation of how results relate to your stated hypotheses

*Noted above.*

* a graph that clearly displays the data

```{r}
library(Rmisc)
damage_summary <- summarySE(damage, measurevar = "leaf_damage", groupvars = "treatment")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(damage_summary, aes(x=treatment, y=leaf_damage))+
  geom_col() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = leaf_damage-ci, ymax = leaf_damage+ci))+
  xlab("Biocontrol treatment")+
  ylab("Number of damaged leaves")+
  ggtitle("Biocontrols differ in impacts on leaf damage")
```
