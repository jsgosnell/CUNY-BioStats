Building on earlier experiments (Quiz 5!), a group of scientists is now considering
if the usefulness of 2 different predators in controlling herbivory by an invasive aphid. 
Scientists measure the number of damaged leaves along 10 m surveys
in fields that have had no biocontrol (control) and those where parasitic wasps (Figure 1)
or predatory
ladybugs (Figure 2) have been released. Data is available using


```{r}
damage <- read.csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRHZzd1CivJEUGnZetFnou_pEgyJD93G2-GHs2wNMMb2p-uXAN9sybg7sPfRcd7i_nUF65bGHwbQ8ph/pub?gid=976089384&single=true&output=csv", header = T, stringsAsFactors = T)
```


How would you evaluate the data?

Make sure your answers include

* null hypothesis
* alternative hypothesis
* explanation for test you will use
* results from statistical test (including post-hoc tests if needed!)
* clear explanation of how results relate to your stated hypotheses
* a graph that clearly displays the data
