Building on earlier experiments (Quiz 5 and 6!), scientists now wonder if the 
impact of the biocontrol agents depends on the presence of an aphid competitor.  Scientists measure the number of damaged leaves along 10 m surveys
in fields that have had no biocontrol (control) and those where parasitic wasps (Figure 1)
or predatory
ladybugs (Figure 2) have been released. These fields also differ in the presence 
of the aphid competitor.  Data is available using


```{r}
damage_competitor <- read.csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTRtyKuFbpcwdBZISTxSI4Eyl7V9fdtH0TyB-Pgwum2YS676Okhu9TtB1n3HlOcXIuYSh--faebX9Gb/pub?gid=1533136727&single=true&output=csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
```


How would you evaluate the data?

Make sure your answers include

* null hypothesis
* alternative hypothesis
* explanation for test you will use
* results from statistical test (including post-hoc tests if needed!)
* clear explanation of how results relate to your stated hypotheses
* a graph that clearly displays the data
