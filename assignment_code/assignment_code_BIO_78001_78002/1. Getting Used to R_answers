Before doing this, review the **Welcome** and **Git** lecture set slides from 
https://sites.google.com/view/biostats/bioenv-2100/welcome and
the  **1_intro_data_lecture.R** script in the lecture_files folder of the
[CUNY-BioStats github repository](https://github.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats).

## Getting your first repository
At this point I'm assuming you received an invitation to view the assignment
on github classroom and accepted it. You now have a private repository of these 
files.  In addition to working on R, we'll have you connect your first
project on Rstudio to this repository and work on some basic git skills.

### If you are using RStudio on your desktop, QUBES, or anywhere that looks like an RStudio screen

To start working on an assignment, open RStudio (on your desktop or cloudserver 
where you actually see the main Rstudio screen). 

![alt text](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3ddyHNvzmRICUa_CmWQmzbz5jr9aTdo_bs9yH9ZbfUPe2LjS46TYj1FsD7CjhKL3rknFZkui-YecWokRGY03cj8occR5HJN56P5N8KJTCUPgciKCAwD8YHJEKXXOOjH-LI8k1G8p88MGB7d_6ov4EJtQQ=w879-h664-no)

Select file, new project, Version control. On the next screen select git. If this
isn't available, you may need to install git (free) on your system.  You can 
download it at https://git-scm.com/download/.  

Next you’ll need to enter the url for your repository. Look for the Code button 
(usually green) in your githbub repository (where you may be reading this...). 

![alt text](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3c6iXUxY_YkEQktN9szfL0Jfl3-jJnjfp2dwbMU_NtnOtoCOFzJcpRN1r0X0zCZlH2gtB9JlXz7_WLgXMBAU7a2K_vwTX5taNBBWwSgsO558aqLZEtKmH_cMpwv7ukzYi7R4ffncWbcscAy8sAzBcZ4Ww=w692-h490-no?authuser=0)

Click it, then copy the 
web url (or click the copy icon). Input that into the Rstudio Repository URL 
space. Then name the project (maybe Assignment 1,2, etc?). The Create project… 
field can be left blank to just save all projects into the main directory.
Alternatively you can click Browse and make an Assignments folder if you want.
Whatever you choose, the project will be saved in new folder in that location 
using the name you chose. Note you may need to enter your github username and password to create the repository. 

Go to the next section (**Now we can actually work in R**) to get started

### If you are using Rstudio cloud...

You'll instead see something like this:

![alt text](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3dVAm8XnMQH9ebnayG0SgBgSewlPFWyJmubIbASefCQ0NKiuZHsQO6eUbzy-Y0LZ6U7KbPkmHCi91tJ4lm7xPs4xf0A3fyMXyMKuzfJ6B2tADIq_NX9GmYRrZS5OuZ6Y1DcCxyzMmmEsV-_DyV9XrLLJA=w1320-h581-no?authuser=0)

To start working on an assignment, select **New Project**, **New Project from Github repo**, 
then enter the url 
for your repository. Look for the Code button 
(usually green) in your githbub repository (where you may be reading this...). 

![alt text](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3c6iXUxY_YkEQktN9szfL0Jfl3-jJnjfp2dwbMU_NtnOtoCOFzJcpRN1r0X0zCZlH2gtB9JlXz7_WLgXMBAU7a2K_vwTX5taNBBWwSgsO558aqLZEtKmH_cMpwv7ukzYi7R4ffncWbcscAy8sAzBcZ4Ww=w692-h490-no?authuser=0)

Click it, then copy the 
web url (or click the copy icon). Input that into the field asking for the URL
of your github repository. 

Note you may need to enter your github username and password to create the repository. 

The next screen will bring you to a "normal" RStudio screen.  Continue to the next
section (**Now we can actually work in R**) to get started

## Now we can actually work in R

Now you can start working on the assignment in Rstudio.  To view instructions, 
open the .Rmd file you want to work on IN RSTUDIO! It will be in the folder for the assignment
you are focusing on. From inside thep project space, go to **File**, **Open File**
and find it, or look in the Files window to find and open the file. 

![alt text](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3esT_YVFqbmcul63AzkXBGrjK5J6kPBMRZW_mT_JNTG7UstxeT9hInq7dA91xV8-e6DbO77u8YepXb6sO6beUo0OlSWg2fXEBbxwgYTHWo7KkZlSAsVfzgpYiL7QbveqRLjctmUYb3RJninK9jMK4DP9A=w800-h452-no?authuser=0)

Then **Knit** the file. Note the first time you do this in a project you may be
prompted to install a number of packages!  If you are using a webservice you may
also need to allow pop-ups in your browser.

![alt text](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3dlSoGJDHtdGqEBr8L2X-yqZ-08Z95RHUMvaxHqF9EOFcBnqtamYMAWOr75mohUSL_KvWtBTt-u4KrdoHgceHc-sZiViw6l9ZqEQToLIsy6AwvQIQMrJgLbtXfV6gNLDgQvgT3N7aq9pk9-x5ugpegjYA=w378-h109-no)

The **Knit** button saves the file and 
shows you a rendered copy of the contents of the editor.  

Now we'll start changing the file.
First, amend the file by replacing the **NAME** and **DATE** spots in the header
(top of the
file between the --- markers) with your name.  

Now click the **Knit** button again.  Now you should see your
name in the preview in the **Viewer** tab. 

Now lets make our first commit.
If you look in the upper right windows, you should see a *Git* tab.  Select it. 

![alt text](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3cew_BrIh1yE8pXRHanoR8pkhTqwPig8u0_jAgldEbZ2mBpE87uUsToH9HYvOsCCCYYJAfY1vVVAOW5evyBIW7NHpWxiS60QZH-2dM9WZnp96r9x3JcBejVWqRxR7tQP81WuDxzk5nRyzLVWDfRD86fiA=w533-h108-no)

Notice it has several files. These are the files you have changed or created since you started working.  Click the checkbox next to the files, and select
**Commit**.  You'll need to enter a description. Put "My first commit!" and
press Commit.  

If you get a screen that looks like this:

![alt text](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3eiPjAQ9iNeBsac3EtLzSqZm1UEen9Apc1HAn7mV6NueYqAlkDGl8AgeBD0_gV21CySVxP5AaQIQDNJYhiAVhN8pqx6eUSIH69DWSQn2-eMMx-802NaxjcJ62pLHMMR2Enin-b2Ex4gb9D88jrQTYEW0w=w749-h331-no?authuser=0)

It just means we need to associate an identity with the commits. To do this,
close (x) the git windows. Select the terminal tab:

![alt text](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3dm7BlCVoK7RYCQS-sB66LWveip4Hude5tmpeALZEMJm_nR1AKVP_R-1SON-7JrvBPNZb28HWBFax2SqRCtf1iJNNUXBrTg6UupRMJhRPZIGWHy1a3QXgQYlwipDxyg0T6K4I7Q5jTVwamUfwgSBfBcpQ=w462-h228-no?authuser=0)

Then paste this line into the terminal,

git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

replace the email with your email (leave the quotes) and press enter.

Then paste this line into the terminal, 

git config --global user.name "Your Name"

replace the Your Name with your name (leave the quotes) and press enter. 

Now go back to the git window and try the commit again. It should work. You will
only have to do this once (for desktop versions) and only occasionally for 
cloud-based RStudio instances.

Now you've saved a snapshot of the file to your local Rstudio instance (on
your own machine or server).  If you go the **Git** tab and select **Diff** and
then **History** on the pop-you, 
you can select the commit, select any file you made, and actually see the
changes.  We'll only focus on the .Rmd files. That's the one you are writing.
The others (the .md in this case) are made automatically and produce the  document
you see when you preview the file and when you view it on github.

Now you need to push these changes to the cloud so I can see (and grade) them.
From the **Git** tab, select **Push**. Note you may need to enter your github 
username and password to create the repository. 
. A window should appear. When it's done
(white text shows) go to your github repository (on the web). Open the folder for this 
assignment and click on the .md file.  It should preview, and you should see the 
updated file with your name!  Congratulations!

As you work, use commits to save snapshots of your work in a version control manner, 
and 
pushes to share them with me.  If you get stuck, you can also push your file up
so I can see it and help you fix it (much better than "My code isn't working). 
Then you can actually see "how" I fixed it.  The code will also be useful for 
assessments.

[comment]:(This is an comment in Rmarkdown. It won't be seen the processed file. I
use these to leave notes that you can ignore.  
ADD HERE IF YOU CAN @TEACHER IN COMMIT FOR HELP!)

Now let's start working in R.  

## R subtleties and functions

1. Let x be defined by


```{r}
x <- 1:10
```
Try executing this chunk (in R studio, not the webview) by clicking the *Run* 
button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing 
*Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

This will run the code in the Console.  You may need to switch to Console (from
Rmarkdown) in the lower right window area to see this.   The executed code is 
also displayed in your processed file (hit **Knit** again to see this!).  

Note running this chunk has added an object named `x` to the **Environment** tab
area (top right area of screen).  But nothing was "returned" in the console.  You
prove this by typing `x` in the console. What does it return?

Determine what the “:” does!  Complete the following sentence:

The : means FILL THIS IN.

2. Now try to guess the output of these commands

* length(x)
* max(x)
* x[x < 5]
* x^2
* x[ x < 8 & x > 2]

INSERT AN R CHUNK HERE AND RUN EACH OF THESE COMMANDS.  Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*. Then state what
each of these does.

3.  Is `-1:2` the same as `(-1):2` or `-(1:2)`? INSERT AN R CHUNK HERE AND RUN EACH OF 
THESE COMMANDS. Then state what each of these does.

## Data input, plotting, and tests

You can read in a dataset from the internet following this protocol.

```{r}
sleep <- read.csv("http://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/master/datasets/sleep.csv")
```

Run this chunk and note it has added an object named `sleep` to the environment. 

Info on the dataset is viewable @ http://www.statsci.org/data/general/sleep.html.

4. How many rows does the **sleep** data set have (hint: `?dim`)?  What kind of data is stored in each variable?

5.  Change the column named *BodyWt* to *Body_weight*”* in the sleep dataset.

ADD ANY R CHUNKS YOU USED TO COMPLETE THE TASK.

6.  Produce a plot of how *TotalSleep* differs between primates and other species. What is this plot showing?

Note, as of early 2020 R no longer reads in strings as factors! This means the 
Primate column, which is full of "Yes"s and "No"s, reads in as words and R doesn't
know how to plot them. There are many ways to handle this. You can modify the 
read.csv command (add  stringsAsFactors = T option), eg
```{r, eval=F}
sleep <- read.csv("http://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/master/datasets/sleep.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
```

or modify the column for the 
actual object 

```{r, eval = F}
sleep$Primate <- factor (sleep$Primate)
```

or for a single command, eg (plot not actually shown!)

```{r, eval = F}
plot(BodyWt ~ factor(Primate), data = sleep)
```


NOTE YOU CAN ADD A PLOT TO THE DOCUMENT TOO! AMEND THE BELOW AS NEEDED.  
```{r}
plot(cars)
```

7.  The **sleep** dataset begs to have a linear model fit for it. Let’s consider. First plot how *TotalSleep* is explained by *BrainWt*. Are there any issues with the data? Exclude any outlier and fit a linear model to obtain the p-value for the model (hint: summary()).  What does this imply?

8.  Sometimes data doesn’t have headers (column names),so you have to add them.
Download a dataset on alcids (birds like puffins and auklets)  from 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/master/datasets/alcids55.csv.  
You’ll need to modify the read.csv function by specifying `header = False`, 
then use the `names` function to name the columns ["year", "a1_abund", "NAO", "a2_abund", "a3_abund", "a4_abund", "a5_abund", "a6_abund"]. 
Try it and check your input using the `head` command.

9.  Here’s a sample dataset:

Date, greenness, Richness, habitat
12-25-2009, 13766, 46, forest
01-01-2010, 50513, 60, forest
01-15-2010, 25084, 60, grassland

Enter it into R (manually or via a .csv). (Hint: you have a piece of this in the code already).  Check your input using the head() command.
