COVID-19 vaccines are a key part of the country's response to the pandemic, but 
they only work if people take them. The CDC keeps detailed records of dosages, 
which I combined with the US Census Bureau's data on regions. Data from:  
* https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-people-onedose-pop-5yr
* https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf

Use the data (combined version provided below) to determine if vaccination rates 
differ by region.

```{r}
vaccine <- read.csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQsI2fpJSpI4pEgvUba3xfafpubrdWj3BaoCigWr4K0eUOGdwWgPygu2-Y6kwqZ-Abi92t4xFDsjbIY/pub?gid=200028780&single=true&output=csv",
                             stringsAsFactors = T)
```
