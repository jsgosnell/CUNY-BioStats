1\. Getting Used to R (and Rstudio, Rmd…and more)\_answers
================
NAME
DATE

Before doing this, review the **Welcome** and **Git** lecture set slides
from <https://sites.google.com/view/biostats/bioenv-2100/welcome> and
the **1\_intro\_data\_lecture.R** script in the lecture\_files folder of
the [CUNY-BioStats github
repository](https://github.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats).

## Getting your first repository

At this point I’m assuming you received an invitation to view the
assignment on github classroom and accepted it. You now have a private
repository of these files. In addition to working on R, we’ll have you
connect your first project on Rstudio to this repository and work on
some basic git skills.

### If you are using RStudio on your desktop, QUBES, or anywhere that looks like an RStudio screen

To start working on an assignment, open RStudio (on your desktop or
cloudserver where you actually see the main Rstudio screen).

![alt

Select file, new project, Version control. On the next screen select
git. If this isn’t available, you may need to install git (free) on your
system. You can download it at <https://git-scm.com/download/>.

Next you’ll need to enter the url for your repository. Look for the Code
button (usually green) in your githbub repository (where you may be
reading this…).

![alt

Click it, then copy the web url (or click the copy icon). Input that
into the Rstudio Repository URL space. Then name the project (maybe
Assignment 1,2, etc?). The Create project… field can be left blank to
just save all projects into the main directory. Alternatively you can
click Browse and make an Assignments folder if you want. Whatever you
choose, the project will be saved in new folder in that location using
the name you chose. Note you may need to enter your github username and
password to create the repository.

Go to the next section (**Now we can actually work in R**) to get
started

### If you are using Rstudio cloud…

You’ll instead see something like this:

![alt

To start working on an assignment, select **New Project**, **New Project
from Github repo**, then enter the url for your repository. Look for the
Code button (usually green) in your githbub repository (where you may be
reading this…).

![alt
text](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3c6iXUxY_YkEQktN9szfL0Jfl3-jJnjfp2dwbMU_NtnOtoCOFzJcpRN1r0X0zCZlH2gtB9JlXz7_WLgXMBAU7a2K_vwTX5taNBBWwSgsO558aqLZEtKmH_cMpwv7ukzYi7R4ffncWbcscAy8sAzBcZ4Ww=w692-h490-no?authuser=0)

Click it, then copy the web url (or click the copy icon). Input that
into the field asking for the URL of your github repository.

Note you may need to enter your github username and password to create
the repository.

The next screen will bring you to a “normal” RStudio screen. Continue to
the next section (**Now we can actually work in R**) to get started

## Now we can actually work in R

Now you can start working on the assignment in Rstudio. To view
instructions, open the .Rmd file you want to work on IN RSTUDIO\! It
will be in the folder for the assignment you are focusing on. From
inside thep project space, go to **File**, **Open File** and find it, or
look in the Files window to find and open the file.

![alt
text](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3esT_YVFqbmcul63AzkXBGrjK5J6kPBMRZW_mT_JNTG7UstxeT9hInq7dA91xV8-e6DbO77u8YepXb6sO6beUo0OlSWg2fXEBbxwgYTHWo7KkZlSAsVfzgpYiL7QbveqRLjctmUYb3RJninK9jMK4DP9A=w800-h452-no?authuser=0)

Then **Knit** the file. Note the first time you do this in a project you
may be prompted to install a number of packages\! If you are using a
webservice you may also need to allow pop-ups in your browser.

![alt
text](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3dlSoGJDHtdGqEBr8L2X-yqZ-08Z95RHUMvaxHqF9EOFcBnqtamYMAWOr75mohUSL_KvWtBTt-u4KrdoHgceHc-sZiViw6l9ZqEQToLIsy6AwvQIQMrJgLbtXfV6gNLDgQvgT3N7aq9pk9-x5ugpegjYA=w378-h109-no)

The **Knit** button saves the file and shows you a rendered copy of the
contents of the editor.

Now we’ll start changing the file. First, amend the file by replacing
the **NAME** and **DATE** spots in the header (top of the file between
the — markers) with your name.

Now click the **Knit** button again. Now you should see your name in the
preview in the **Viewer** tab.

Now lets make our first commit. If you look in the upper right windows,
you should see a *Git* tab. Select it.

![alt
text](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3cew_BrIh1yE8pXRHanoR8pkhTqwPig8u0_jAgldEbZ2mBpE87uUsToH9HYvOsCCCYYJAfY1vVVAOW5evyBIW7NHpWxiS60QZH-2dM9WZnp96r9x3JcBejVWqRxR7tQP81WuDxzk5nRyzLVWDfRD86fiA=w533-h108-no)

Notice it has several files. These are the files you have changed or
created since you started working. Click the checkbox next to the files,
and select **Commit**. You’ll need to enter a description. Put “My first
commit\!” and press Commit.

If you get a screen that looks like this:

![alt
text](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3eiPjAQ9iNeBsac3EtLzSqZm1UEen9Apc1HAn7mV6NueYqAlkDGl8AgeBD0_gV21CySVxP5AaQIQDNJYhiAVhN8pqx6eUSIH69DWSQn2-eMMx-802NaxjcJ62pLHMMR2Enin-b2Ex4gb9D88jrQTYEW0w=w749-h331-no?authuser=0)

It just means we need to associate an identity with the commits. To do
this, close (x) the git windows. Select the terminal tab:

![alt
text](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3dm7BlCVoK7RYCQS-sB66LWveip4Hude5tmpeALZEMJm_nR1AKVP_R-1SON-7JrvBPNZb28HWBFax2SqRCtf1iJNNUXBrTg6UupRMJhRPZIGWHy1a3QXgQYlwipDxyg0T6K4I7Q5jTVwamUfwgSBfBcpQ=w462-h228-no?authuser=0)

Then paste this line into the terminal,

git config –global user.email “<you@example.com>”

replace the email with your email (leave the quotes) and press enter.

Then paste this line into the terminal,

git config –global user.name “Your Name”

replace the Your Name with your name (leave the quotes) and press enter.

Now go back to the git window and try the commit again. It should work.
You will only have to do this once (for desktop versions) and only
occasionally for cloud-based RStudio instances.

Now you’ve saved a snapshot of the file to your local Rstudio instance
(on your own machine or server). If you go the **Git** tab and select
**Diff** and then **History** on the pop-you, you can select the commit,
select any file you made, and actually see the changes. We’ll only focus
on the .Rmd files. That’s the one you are writing. The others (the .md
in this case) are made automatically and produce the document you see
when you preview the file and when you view it on github.

Now you need to push these changes to the cloud so I can see (and grade)
them. From the **Git** tab, select **Push**. Note you may need to enter
your github username and password to create the repository. . A window
should appear. When it’s done (white text shows) go to your github
repository (on the web). Open the folder for this assignment and click
on the .md file. It should preview, and you should see the updated file
with your name\! Congratulations\!

As you work, use commits to save snapshots of your work in a version
control manner, and pushes to share them with me. If you get stuck, you
can also push your file up so I can see it and help you fix it (much
better than “My code isn’t working). Then you can actually see”how" I
fixed it. The code will also be useful for assessments.

Now let’s start working in R.

## R subtleties and functions

1.  Let x be defined by

<!-- end list -->

``` r
x <- 1:10
```

Try executing this chunk (in R studio, not the webview) by clicking the
*Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and
pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

This will run the code in the Console. You may need to switch to Console
(from Rmarkdown) in the lower right window area to see this. The
executed code is also displayed in your processed file (hit **Knit**
again to see this\!).

Note running this chunk has added an object named `x` to the
**Environment** tab area (top right area of screen). But nothing was
“returned” in the console. You prove this by typing `x` in the
console. What does it return?

Determine what the “:” does\! Complete the following sentence:

``` r
x <- 1:10
```

*The : means “create a sequence counting by 1’s from a to b (in a:b)”.*

2.  Now try to guess the output of these commands

<!-- end list -->

  - length(x)
  - max(x)
  - x\[x \< 5\]
  - x^2
  - x\[ x \< 8 & x \> 2\]

INSERT AN R CHUNK HERE AND RUN EACH OF THESE COMMANDS. Add a new chunk
by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing
*Ctrl+Alt+I*. Then state what each of these does.

``` r
length(x)
```

    ## [1] 10

``` r
max(x)
```

    ## [1] 10

``` r
x[x < 5]
```

    ## [1] 1 2 3 4

``` r
x^2
```

    ##  [1]   1   4   9  16  25  36  49  64  81 100

``` r
x[ x < 8 & x > 2]
```

    ## [1] 3 4 5 6 7

*Length of x returns the number of elements in a vector. max returns the
highest value. square brackets allows you to return (or work with) only
portions of a vector. ^2 squares a value.*

3.  Is `-1:2` the same as `(-1):2` or `-(1:2)`? INSERT AN R CHUNK HERE
    AND RUN EACH OF THESE COMMANDS. Then state what each of these does.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
-1:2
```

    ## [1] -1  0  1  2

``` r
(-1):2
```

    ## [1] -1  0  1  2

``` r
-(1:2)
```

    ## [1] -1 -2

*The first creates a sequence from -1 to 2 by ones (see question 1). The
second does the same. The third creates a sequence from 1 to 2 then
applies a negative to it.*

## Data input, plotting, and tests

You can read in a dataset from the internet following this protocol.

``` r
sleep <- read.csv("http://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/master/datasets/sleep.csv")
```

Run this chunk and note it has added an object named `sleep` to the
environment.

*Make sure you see the object in the environment tab\!*

Info on the dataset is viewable @
<http://www.statsci.org/data/general/sleep.html>.

4.  How many rows does the **sleep** data set have (hint: `?dim`)? What
    kind of data is stored in each variable?

ENTER ANSWERS HERE. ADD ANY R CHUNKS YOU USED TO FIND THE ANSWER.

``` r
dim(sleep)
```

    ## [1] 62 12

*dim returns the number of rows and columns (IN THAT ORDER) in a
dataframe\! So sleep has 62 rows. NOTE: If you look at the .Rmd code
here, you can see how to put R output inline (instead of in chunks).*

5.  Change the column named *BodyWt* to *Body\_weight*”\* in the sleep
    dataset.

ADD ANY R CHUNKS YOU USED TO COMPLETE THE TASK.

``` r
names(sleep)[names(sleep) %in% "BodyWt"] = "Body_weight"
```

6.  Produce a plot of how *TotalSleep* differs between primates and
    other species. What is this plot showing?

Note, as of early 2020 R no longer reads in strings as factors\! This
means the Primate column, which is full of “Yes”s and “No”s, reads in as
words and R doesn’t know how to plot them. There are many ways to handle
this. You can modify the read.csv command (add stringsAsFactors = T
option), eg\*

``` r
sleep <- read.csv("http://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/master/datasets/sleep.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
```

If you do this, you’ll need to rechange anything you previously updated
to the object (like renaming the BodyWt column).

You can also modify a single column for the actual object

``` r
sleep$Primate <- factor (sleep$Primate)
```

or for a single command, eg (plot not actually shown\!)

``` r
plot(BodyWt ~ factor(Primate), data = sleep)
```

NOTE YOU CAN ADD A PLOT TO THE DOCUMENT TOO\! AMEND THE BELOW AS NEEDED.

``` r
plot(cars)
```

![](1.-Getting-Used-to-R_answers_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

*Answer is*

``` r
plot(TotalSleep ~ factor(Primate), sleep)
```

![](1.-Getting-Used-to-R_answers_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->

*or to clean it up (we’ll introduce ggplot2 in a few sessions to help
with this)*

``` r
plot(TotalSleep ~ factor(Primate), sleep, main = "Variance in sleep differs between primates and non-primates", 
     xlab = "Primate", ylab = "Total sleep (hours)")
```

![](1.-Getting-Used-to-R_answers_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

7.  The **sleep** dataset begs to have a linear model fit for it. Let’s
    consider. First plot how *TotalSleep* is explained by *BrainWt*. Are
    there any issues with the data? Exclude any outlier and fit a linear
    model to obtain the p-value for the model (hint: summary()). What
    does this imply?

ENTER ANSWERS HERE. ADD ANY R CHUNKS YOU USED TO FIND THE ANSWER.

*First look for outliers (before fitting a model)*

``` r
plot(TotalSleep ~ BrainWt, sleep)
```

![](1.-Getting-Used-to-R_answers_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)<!-- -->

*We have few measurements where BrainWt \>1000, so let’s exclude those
for the model*

``` r
sleep_fit <- lm(TotalSleep ~ BrainWt, sleep[sleep$BrainWt<1000,])
summary(sleep_fit)
```

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## lm(formula = TotalSleep ~ BrainWt, data = sleep[sleep$BrainWt < 
    ##     1000, ])
    ## 
    ## Residuals:
    ##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
    ## -8.0342 -2.8719  0.1718  2.0426  7.8037 
    ## 
    ## Coefficients:
    ##              Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
    ## (Intercept) 12.099991   0.632611  19.127  < 2e-16 ***
    ## BrainWt     -0.014926   0.003833  -3.894 0.000278 ***
    ## ---
    ## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
    ## 
    ## Residual standard error: 4.021 on 53 degrees of freedom
    ##   (4 observations deleted due to missingness)
    ## Multiple R-squared:  0.2224, Adjusted R-squared:  0.2078 
    ## F-statistic: 15.16 on 1 and 53 DF,  p-value: 0.0002782

*We see a significant (p \<.05, don’t worry, we’ll see this later)
relationship between BrainWt and TotalSleep, and it appears that
TotalSleep decreases as BrainWt increases (note the negative estimate).
We can visualize this using*

``` r
plot(TotalSleep ~ BrainWt, data = sleep[sleep$BrainWt <  1000, ])
abline(sleep_fit)
```

8.  Sometimes data doesn’t have headers (column names),so you have to
    add them. Download a dataset on alcids (birds like puffins and
    auklets) from
    <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/master/datasets/alcids55.csv>.  
    You’ll need to modify the read.csv function by specifying `header =
    False`, then use the `names` function to name the columns \[“year”,
    “a1\_abund”, “NAO”, “a2\_abund”, “a3\_abund”, “a4\_abund”,
    “a5\_abund”, “a6\_abund”\]. Try it and check your input using the
    `head` command.
