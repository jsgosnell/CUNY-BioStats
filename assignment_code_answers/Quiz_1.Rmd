# Medical applications of oxygen

A study was done to determine if oxygen was being appropriately supplied to patients
in a medical unit (Barrett et al 2020). They surveyed 636 patients in multiple wards and
found 66 were using oxygen.  Oxygen saturation levels were measured for each patient
using oxygen.  Create a properly-labeled plot that  shows saturation levels using ggplot2.

Data can be loaded using 

```{r}
oxygen_use <- read.csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSC8ft2LReouozG9fDK0Pa-QXESZ82qzADTCCBr_LoQeVRlRDLS4KOhMNYjGnGZFTrq5hkuYcOk6cKm/pub?gid=1295231330&single=true&output=csv",
                       stringsAsFactors = T)
```
